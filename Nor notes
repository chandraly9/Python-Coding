What are the phases of development, what is the first milestone we will hit? When are we starting to build stuff 

please let me know if the documentation has to be moved to any other place, I believe i created it in the right confluence channel, you can use this page to review the content, This document describes the automation process flow for managing A10 load balancers, focusing on routine tasks such as adding, removing, or adjusting servers within service groups. The process is outlined in two sequence diagrams, which serve as a guide for both technical implementation and project management purposes. The diagrams in the confluence page illustrate the steps from user input to the final deployment and monitoring stages. After the main automation task is complete, the focus will shift to other areas such as blue-green deployment strategies, pool swapping in Terraform, SSL template integration, and URL redirection, this document is specifically for managing A10 load balancers through Automation for adding, removing, or adjusting servers within service groups, please take a look. Thank you


Thank you for reviewing the documentation on the Confluence page. To answer your questions:

Phases of Development
The development for the A10 load balancer automation is structured into several phases:
