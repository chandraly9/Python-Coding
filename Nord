Thanks for the detailed plan. This process makes sense, but I have a few comments.

 

“Development and Testing” section contains some duplicate items
“Task: Integrate Terraform with A10 Thunder Provider” task seems like a duplication of the previous task. You will need to integrate the provider to develop the service group management code, right?
“Sub-task: Schedule and execute penetration testing for the automation workflow.” – what will be tested here? Does this solution include any server endpoints or just CI/CD job execution?
