Subject: Re: Meet Satish Chandra (CDW Contractor)

Thanks to @Hiatt, Steve/ @Ervin, Brian/ @Lund, Bradley/ @Fowler, Jake and @Anand, Animesh for providing me a KT on Monday, Really appreciate. it helped me to do some deep dive into the A10 Automation Planning and Strategy.

 

I've created process automation flow sequence diagrams with detailed explanations outlining our approach to a journey of a successful automation here. This will also help our program/project manager to create JIRA stories/tickets for me based on my diagrams and explanations. Initially, We should focus on automating routine tasks, such as adding, removing, or adjusting servers within service groups, in line with Nordstrom's infrastructure. Please review and understand the process and diagrams I've provided/created for our initial focus for adding, removing and/or adjusting servers within service groups. 

Team, I'm open to making any changes either in the process automation or in the diagrams based on your feedback. Additionally, we'll explore other areas like handling blue-green deployment strategies and pool swapping in Terraform, as well as SSL template integration and URL redirection. These can be addressed in the coming weeks once we've completed the main automation task.

 

P.F.A(please find the attachments)

User Creates/Edits YAML File: The process initiates with the user creating or editing a YAML file. This file is crucial as it contains all the necessary configuration details for A10 load balancers, service groups, and servers. The YAML format makes it user-friendly and easy to manage these configurations. 
Input YAML File to Python Script: This YAML file is then inputted into a Python script. The primary function of this script is to parse the YAML file, extracting and interpreting the configuration data. This step is essential for converting the user-defined configurations into a format that can be processed further for generating Terraform configurations. 
Python Script Generates Terraform Configurations: The Python script takes the data extracted from the YAML file and generates Terraform configuration files. These files (*.tf) are written in Terraform's native language, HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), and they define how the A10 load balancers, service groups, and servers should be set up. 
Integration of Terraform Provider Thunder in Configuration Management: At this stage, the Terraform configurations, now tailored for the A10 Terraform Provider (terraform-provider-thunder), are integrated into the configuration management process. This integration is pivotal for leveraging Terraform's capabilities in managing the A10 load balancer infrastructure efficiently. 
CI/CD Pipeline Deploys Changes to A10 Load Balancers: The Terraform configurations are then deployed to the A10 load balancers through a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This pipeline automates the deployment process, ensuring that the configurations are correctly applied to the load balancers. 
A10 Load Balancers Configured by Terraform A10 Provider: In this step, the A10 load balancers are configured according to the Terraform configurations using the A10 Terraform Provider. This provider ensures that the specific features and capabilities of the A10 load balancers are appropriately utilized and managed. 
Setup of Monitoring System by Terraform and A10 Provider: Alongside configuring the load balancers, Terraform and the A10 provider work together to set up a monitoring system. This system is responsible for continuously overseeing the performance and health of the A10 load balancers and service groups. 
Monitoring System Sends Alerts and Notifications to User: The monitoring system plays a critical role in maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the load balancers. It sends alerts and notifications to the user if it detects any issues, such as load balancer failures, server health problems, or performance degradation in service groups.

User Creates/Edits YAML File: The process begins with the user creating or editing a YAML file. This file contains the necessary configuration details for the desired infrastructure. It serves as the blueprint from which the Terraform configurations will be generated. 
Input YAML File to Python Script: The YAML file is then provided as input to a Python script. The role of this script is to parse the YAML file and extract the relevant configuration data. This step is crucial as it translates user-defined infrastructure specifications into a format that can be further processed for Terraform configuration. 
Python Script Generates Terraform Configurations: The Python script processes the data from the YAML file and generates Terraform configuration files. These files are written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and define the infrastructure setup in a format that Terraform can understand and act upon. 
Integration of Terraform Configurations with CI/CD Pipeline: The generated Terraform configurations are then integrated into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This integration is key for automating the deployment process. The CI/CD pipeline manages version control, tests the configurations for errors or conflicts, and prepares them for deployment. 
CI/CD Pipeline Deploys Changes to Infrastructure: Once the Terraform configurations pass through the CI/CD pipeline's testing and preparation stages, they are deployed to the target infrastructure. This step involves the actual provisioning or updating of infrastructure resources as defined in the Terraform configurations.
Infrastructure Configuration with Terraform: Terraform interacts with the infrastructure, applying the configurations specified in the .tf files. This step is where Terraform directly manages the infrastructure, ensuring that it matches the desired state as defined in the configurations. 
Terraform Sets Up Monitoring System: Alongside configuring the infrastructure, Terraform (or an integrated tool) sets up a monitoring system. This system is responsible for continuously monitoring the health and performance of the infrastructure. It can track various metrics and logs to ensure everything is functioning as expected. 
Monitoring System Sends Alerts and Notifications to User: If the monitoring system detects any issues, anomalies, or if certain thresholds are crossed, it sends alerts and notifications to the user. This ensures that the user is kept informed about the state of the infrastructure and can take prompt action if necessary.
